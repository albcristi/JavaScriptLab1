# JavaScriptLab1
This is my first laboratory on JavaScript from the Web Programming class
Write a javascript which sorts in ascending order an array of numbers which are introduced by the user in a "textarea" or "input type=text" tag. The sorted array (which can have any length) will be displayed in a <table> with 5 columns and n/5 lines where n is the length of the array.
